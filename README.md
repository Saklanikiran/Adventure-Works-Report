## Problem Statement

The Adventure Works company generates large volumes of sales, customer, and product data across multiple regions, but stakeholders lacked a centralized and interactive reporting system to track performance. Traditional reporting methods were time-consuming, static, and did not provide actionable insights into key areas such as revenue growth, customer behavior, regional sales distribution, and product returns. This created challenges in making timely, data-driven business decisions.

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Data Import & Preparation – Loaded the Adventure Works dataset into Power BI, cleaned and structured the data for analysis.

- Step 2 : Data Modeling – Created relationships between tables (sales, customers, products....) and built a snowflake schema for smooth reporting.

- Step 3 : DAX Measures – Wrote DAX formulas to calculate KPIs like Revenue, Profit, Orders, Returns, and Return Rate.

- Step 4 : Executive Dashboard – Designed a summary page with key KPIs, revenue trends, category-wise sales, and top products.

- Step 5 : Map Page – Built interactive maps to analyze sales performance across regions and countries.

- Step 6 : Customer Detail Page – Showed customer demographics, order patterns, and behavior insights.

- Step 7 : Product Detail Page – Added drill-through functionality for detailed product performance with KPI gauges, trend charts, field parameters, and what-if analysis.

- Step 8 : Category Tooltip – Created tooltips to show quick category-level insights (revenue, profit, orders, returns, and trends) on hover.

- Step 9 : Report Formatting – Applied consistent design, slicers, navigation buttons, and interactivity for a professional user experience.

- Step 10 : Insights & Analysis – Delivered a final report enabling stakeholders to explore data dynamically and make data-driven decisions.
